            <h2>Discovery of Mini-Neptunes</h2>
            <p>Mini-Neptunes are exoplanets with sizes between that of Earth and Neptune, typically having thick atmospheres and low densities. They are smaller than gas giants but larger than terrestrial planets, which makes them a unique type of exoplanet. The first Mini-Neptune was discovered by the <strong>Kepler Space Telescope</strong> in 2009. These planets are often found in compact orbits around their stars.</p>
            <p>Mini-Neptunes challenged planetary formation models by showing that planets of this size can retain thick atmospheres, unlike Earth-like planets. Their atmospheres may contain hydrogen and helium or even water vapor, depending on the distance from their star.</p>

            <h2>Types of Mini-Neptunes</h2>
            <p>Mini-Neptunes are classified into two main categories based on their atmospheric composition and proximity to their host star:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gas-Dominated Mini-Neptunes:</strong> These exoplanets have thick atmospheres primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. They are similar to Neptune in terms of composition but are smaller in size and mass.</li>
                <li><strong>Water-World Mini-Neptunes:</strong> Some Mini-Neptunes are thought to have atmospheres rich in water vapor, and their surfaces may be covered in deep oceans beneath thick clouds, earning them the nickname "water worlds."</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Current Data on Mini-Neptunes</h2>
            <p>Mini-Neptunes are common in planetary systems outside our solar system, and here are some notable examples and data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kepler-138d:</strong> This Mini-Neptune orbits a red dwarf star and is notable for having a density lower than water, suggesting it may be a water-world or have a thick gas envelope. It is located about 200 light-years away from Earth.</li>
                <li><strong>K2-18b:</strong> This exoplanet, classified as a Mini-Neptune, was found to have water vapor in its atmosphere, making it one of the first exoplanets with potential conditions for supporting life.</li>
                <li><strong>TOI-849b:</strong> TOI-849b is an unusual Mini-Neptune with a stripped atmosphere, making it a "naked core." Scientists believe it may have once been a gas giant, now reduced to its dense core.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In 2024, over 1,000 Mini-Neptunes have been discovered, providing valuable insights into planetary formation and the diversity of planetary systems.</p>
