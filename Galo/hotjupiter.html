            <h2>Discovery of Hot Jupiters</h2>
            <p>Hot Jupiters were first discovered in 1995 when astronomers detected 51 Pegasi b, a gas giant orbiting extremely close to its parent star. This marked a major breakthrough in exoplanet research, as it challenged existing theories of planetary formation.</p>

            <h2>Types of Hot Jupiters</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Classical Hot Jupiters:</strong> Gas giants that orbit very close to their parent star, resulting in high surface temperatures. These planets can have orbits as short as a few days.</li>
                <li><strong>Ultra-hot Jupiters:</strong> A sub-class of hot Jupiters that have extreme temperatures, often exceeding 2000°C, caused by their close proximity to their star.</li>
                <li><strong>Puffy Hot Jupiters:</strong> Hot Jupiters with lower density but large radii, often caused by the intense heat that causes their atmospheres to expand.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Current Data on Hot Jupiters</h2>
            <p>As of 2024, over <strong>400 hot Jupiters</strong> have been discovered. Their orbits range from 0.01 to 0.1 AU (Astronomical Units) from their parent stars. Some of the most well-known hot Jupiters include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>WASP-121b:</strong> Known for its ultra-hot temperature and stratosphere.</li>
                <li><strong>HD 209458 b:</strong> Famous for having water vapor detected in its atmosphere.</li>
                <li><strong>Kepler-13A b:</strong> One of the hottest known hot Jupiters, with an atmospheric temperature of nearly 3000°C.</li>
            </ul>
