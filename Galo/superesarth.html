            <h2>Discovery of Super Earths</h2>
            <p>Super Earths are exoplanets with masses larger than Earth's but significantly smaller than those of Uranus or Neptune. The term "Super Earth" refers only to the planet's mass and not its composition or habitability. The first Super Earth, <strong>Gliese 876d</strong>, was discovered in 2005 orbiting a red dwarf star. This discovery challenged astronomers, as it indicated that planets of this mass could exist in stable orbits around stars.</p>
            <p>Since then, over 1,500 Super Earths have been discovered, many within the habitable zones of their stars, sparking interest in their potential to host life.</p>

            <h2>Types of Super Earths</h2>
            <p>Super Earths can have varying compositions, ranging from rocky, Earth-like planets to water worlds and gas-dominated exoplanets. There are three primary types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rocky Super Earths:</strong> These planets have solid surfaces, similar to Earth or Venus, but are larger in mass and size. They may have mountains, oceans, and possibly plate tectonics.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Worlds:</strong> These are Super Earths that are believed to be covered in deep global oceans. Their surfaces might be completely submerged beneath thick layers of water.</li>
                <li><strong>Gas-rich Super Earths:</strong> These Super Earths have a significant portion of their mass in the form of a dense atmosphere, making them more similar to mini-Neptunes than terrestrial planets.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Current Data on Super Earths</h2>
            <p>Super Earths are among the most commonly discovered exoplanets. Below is a summary of the current understanding and notable discoveries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gliese 1214 b:</strong> A water-rich Super Earth, believed to have a thick atmosphere that may include water vapor or clouds. It orbits a red dwarf star, about 40 light-years away.</li>
                <li><strong>Kepler-452b:</strong> One of the most Earth-like Super Earths discovered, it orbits in the habitable zone of a Sun-like star. This planet is about 60% larger than Earth and may have active volcanism and a rocky surface.</li>
                <li><strong>LHS 1140b:</strong> A dense rocky Super Earth orbiting within the habitable zone of its star, it is one of the best candidates for studying a potentially habitable exoplanet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In 2024, scientists continue to explore over 1,500 confirmed Super Earths, many of which reside in their stars' habitable zones, raising questions about their potential for supporting life.</p>
