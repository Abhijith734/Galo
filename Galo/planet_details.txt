Imagine a planet bigger than Jupiter, but way hotter! That's 75 Cet b, a giant planet orbiting a star called 75 Ceti. Here's the fun part: 

* **It's a super-hot Jupiter:**  This planet is a gas giant, just like Jupiter, but it's way closer to its star. That means it's scorching hot, with a temperature hotter than a pizza oven! 
* **A quick orbit:**  75 Cet b whizzes around its star super fast. It takes just 3.5 days to make one full orbit! That's like a super-fast roller coaster ride!
* **A distant neighbor:** 75 Ceti is a star that's about 41 light-years away from Earth. That means it's a long way to travel, even for a spaceship!
* **We found it with a wobble:** Astronomers found 75 Cet b by looking at the star it orbits. The planet's gravity makes the star wobble a little bit, which tells us the planet is there! 

So, 75 Cet b is a fascinating world with a lot of exciting secrets waiting to be discovered!
