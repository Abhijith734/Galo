        <h1>Exoplanets</h1>
        <p>Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets, are celestial bodies that orbit stars outside our solar system. These fascinating worlds vary in size, composition, and distance from their stars, presenting exciting possibilities for the existence of life beyond Earth. Their study helps scientists understand planetary formation, evolution, and the conditions necessary for life.</p>

    <section class="section" id="types-of-exoplanets">
        <h2>Types of Exoplanets</h2>
        <p>Exoplanets can be categorized based on their characteristics, such as size and composition. Major types include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gas Giants:</strong> Massive planets with thick atmospheres, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.</li>
            <li><strong>Rocky Planets:</strong> Earth-like planets with solid surfaces, primarily made of rock and metal.</li>
            <li><strong>Ice Giants:</strong> Planets with icy compositions, including water, ammonia, and methane.</li>
            <li><strong>Super-Earths:</strong> Larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune, often found in habitable zones.</li>
        </ul>

                <img src="https://i.ibb.co/bmsbZKJ/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Hot Jupiter">
                <p>Hot Jupiters are gas giants that orbit very close to their stars, resulting in extremely high surface temperatures. These planets challenge traditional models of planetary formation.</p>

                <h3>Super-Earths</h3>
                <img src="https://i.ibb.co/bmsbZKJ/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Super Earth">
                <p>Super-Earths are a class of exoplanets with a mass larger than Earth's but smaller than that of Neptune. They are found in the habitable zones of their stars, making them prime candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

            <div class="exoplanet-box">
                <h3>Ice Giants</h3>
                <img src="https://i.ibb.co/z88qcT2/images.jpg" alt="Ice Giants">
                <p>Ice giants like Uranus and Neptune are primarily composed of water, ammonia, and methane. Their unique atmospheres and cold temperatures make them distinct from gas giants.</p>

                <img src="https://i.ibb.co/x2G231K/images.jpg" alt="Terrestrial Planets">
                <p>Terrestrial planets are rocky bodies similar to Earth, featuring solid surfaces and potential atmospheres that could support life. They are often located in the habitable zone of their stars.</p>
