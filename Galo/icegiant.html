        <h1>Ice Giants: Discovery and Exploration</h1>
        
        <h2>What are Ice Giants?</h2>
        <p>Ice giants are a category of planets primarily composed of substances that are in a frozen state, such as water, ammonia, and methane. They differ from gas giants due to their smaller size and higher proportion of icy materials. The two most prominent ice giants in our solar system are Uranus and Neptune.</p>
        
        <h2>Discovery of Ice Giants</h2>
        <p>Ice giants were discovered through advancements in telescopic technology. Uranus was discovered in 1781 by Sir William Herschel, and Neptune followed in 1846, confirmed through mathematical predictions based on Uranus's orbit. These discoveries marked significant milestones in our understanding of the solar system.</p>
        
        <h2>Characteristics of Ice Giants</h2>
        <p>Key features of ice giants include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Mainly composed of water, ammonia, and methane in icy forms.</li>
            <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Thin atmospheres dominated by hydrogen and helium, with traces of methane giving them a blue color.</li>
            <li><strong>Magnetic Field:</strong> Unusual magnetic fields that are tilted relative to their rotational axes.</li>
            <li><strong>Moons:</strong> Both Uranus and Neptune have numerous moons, some of which are large and geologically active.</li>
            <li><strong>Rings:</strong> Both planets have faint rings composed of ice and dust particles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Ice Giants</h2>
        <p>In our solar system, the two recognized ice giants are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Uranus:</strong> Known for its unique tilt of about 98 degrees, which results in extreme seasonal variations. It has a cold atmosphere with temperatures dropping to around -224Â°C. Uranus has 27 known moons, with Titania and Oberon being the largest.</li>
            <li><strong>Neptune:</strong> The farthest planet from the Sun, Neptune has the fastest winds recorded in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 km/h. Neptune has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest and geologically active.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Current Research and Future Missions</h2>
        <p>Recent observations from telescopes like Hubble and missions like Voyager 2 have provided valuable insights into the ice giants:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Studies reveal dynamic weather systems and storm patterns on both planets.</li>
            <li>Future missions are being planned to investigate the ice giants more thoroughly, with proposed concepts like the Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission.</li>
            <li>Scientists are studying the atmospheres of ice giants to understand their composition and weather patterns better.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
        <p>Here are some intriguing facts about ice giants:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uranus has a unique feature known as "the Great Dark Spot," similar to Neptune's storm system.</li>
            <li>Neptune's atmosphere contains active weather systems, including large storms and high-speed winds.</li>
            <li>Triton, Neptune's largest moon, is one of the few moons in the solar system known to have a retrograde orbit, suggesting it may have been captured by Neptune's gravity.</li>
            <li>Uranus' tilt causes extreme seasonal changes, with each pole getting 42 years of continuous sunlight or darkness during its 84-year orbit around the Sun.</li>
