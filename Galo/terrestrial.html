            <h2>Discovery of Terrestrial Planets</h2>
            <p>Terrestrial planets, also known as rocky planets, are composed mainly of silicate rocks or metals. They are smaller and denser than gas giants, with solid surfaces that can feature mountains, valleys, craters, and volcanoes. In our Solar System, the terrestrial planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.</p>
            <p>Early discoveries of terrestrial planets date back to ancient times, with visible planets like Mars and Venus being observed by early astronomers. Modern telescopes and space missions, such as those by NASA, have given us detailed insights into their geology and atmospheres.</p>

            <h2>Types of Terrestrial Planets</h2>
            <p>There are four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, each unique in its composition and environment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mercury:</strong> The closest planet to the Sun with a barren surface, extreme temperatures, and almost no atmosphere.</li>
                <li><strong>Venus:</strong> Often called Earth's twin due to its similar size, Venus has a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, causing extreme surface temperatures.</li>
                <li><strong>Earth:</strong> The only planet known to support life, with liquid water on its surface and a balanced atmosphere.</li>
                <li><strong>Mars:</strong> Known as the Red Planet due to its iron-rich surface, Mars has polar ice caps and is the target of many exploration missions.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="current-data-section">
            <h2>Current Data on Terrestrial Planets</h2>
            <p>Here are some notable terrestrial planets and current exploration data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mercury:</strong> NASA’s MESSENGER mission has provided detailed images and data on Mercury’s surface and magnetic field.</li>
                <li><strong>Venus:</strong> ESA's Venus Express and NASA’s planned missions like DAVINCI+ will explore Venus’s thick atmosphere and surface conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Mars:</strong> NASA’s Perseverance rover is currently exploring Mars, searching for signs of past life and preparing for future human exploration.</li>
                <li><strong>Earth:</strong> As the only planet known to harbor life, Earth’s biosphere is constantly monitored by satellites and space missions to better understand our home.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>New missions continue to provide data on these planets, expanding our understanding of their formation, evolution, and potential for habitability.</p>
