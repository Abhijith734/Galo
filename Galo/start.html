        <p>
            Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. These fascinating celestial bodies come in many forms, 
            from gas giants larger than Jupiter to rocky planets similar to Earth. The discovery of exoplanets has revolutionized our 
            understanding of the universe, raising the possibility of finding life beyond our planet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the first confirmed detection of an exoplanet in 1992, astronomers have identified thousands of exoplanets, many of 
            which reside in the habitable zone of their stars, where conditions may be right for liquid water and potentially life. 
            The study of exoplanets continues to be a rapidly evolving field, with missions such as the Kepler Space Telescope and 
            the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) leading the charge in discovering new worlds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding the atmospheres, compositions, and orbits of these planets can provide insights into how planetary systems 
            form and evolve. As technology advances, we may soon discover Earth-like planets in other star systems, which could change 
            our perspective on the universe and our place within it.
